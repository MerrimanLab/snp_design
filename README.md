# Annotate a sequence segment with SNPs/variants
## This script is intended for use when designing custom TaqMan probes or Sequenom / GeneWorks assays.

## To install this script package:

 - Download a .zip file of this repository
 - To install the package unzip the file (put it somewhere save eg. home/Executables) and cd into it (in Terminal)
 - In Terminal type:

```
        python2.7 setup.py install --user
```

 - Check that python is also in your bash PATH
 - In Terminal type:

```
        nano ~/.bashrc
```

 - In the window that opens check there is a line that says:


```
        export PATH=$PATH:/Users/[yourhomefolder]/Library/Python/2.7/bin
```

 - Save any edits you make in this window then type:

```
        ln -s ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile
        source ~/.bashrc
```

 - Now this script is set up as a command line program for you to use!

## To run this script:

### You will need:

 - A .vcf.gz file to extract SNPs/variants of interest from and the corresponding index file (.vcf.gz.tbi) 
 - A .fasta file of the same genome build your vcf uses to specify SNP/variant positions
 - The chromosome and position of your SNP of interest
 - The base corresponding to the alternate allele

### Command Arguments:

 - Required arguments:

```
        -v, --vcf VCF_FILE
                        a bgzipped VCF file (extension .vcf.gz), this file
                        also requires an index file (extension .vcf.gz.tbi)
        -f, --fasta FASTA
                        Fasta file
        -c, --chr CHROMOSOME
                        Chromosome to extract region from; check whether your
                        vcf uses 'chr1' or '1' formatting
        -p, --pos POSITION_SNP
                        Position of the SNP 
        -a, --alt ALTERNATE_ALLELE
                        What the alternate allele is
```

 - Optional arguments:

```
        -m, --mask MASK_CHARACTER
                        Do you want nearby SNPs labelled with iupac codes or
                        Ns?, Default = 'iupac', Alternate = 'N'
        -s, --size SIZE_REGION
                        How much sequence either side of you SNP do you want?
                        Default = 200
        -o, --output OUTPUT_FILE
                        What do you want to call the output file name? Default
                        = chr.pos
```

### Example Usage and Output:

```
annotate_sequence --vcf polyReSeq.vcf.gz --fasta human_build37.fasta --chr chr11 --pos 64323183 --alt T --size 300 --output 11_64323183_poly
